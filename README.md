# Fdf

Simple first graphical project that has for objective to parse a map of points and to display
it on screen with lines linking the points toghether.

The main difficulty of this project was to take the input of the text file and to transfer it to
something that can be more easily manipulated. After that it was quite easy to apply transformation
by doing matrix operation and drawing lines using basic 42 graphics library by putting pixels on the screen.
